                <p>Dear Pau,</p>
                <p>
                    Congratulations on your boards! I am so proud of you. I made this website project just for you. 
                    Here's a tulip flowervase because I can't give you one physically. I hope you accept this instead!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I remember a scene from Robin William's film "Good Will Hunting", where he discusses the correlation of love and regret. 
                    Robin shares about little imperfect moments like how his late wife used to fart in her sleep. In analogy, I love how you tend to get 
                    embarrassed when you do something cheesy or especially the time when you tried to feed me chicken and I fumbled it, it was so funny that we 
                    talked about it afterwards to clear up the misunderstanding. Love isn't about perfection; its about cherishing the real, everyday moments, flaws 
                    and all. He said, “People call these things imperfections, but they're not. Ah, that's the good stuff.”

                </p>
                    
                <p> 
                    Recalling about the moment we shared made me realized how much I value the time we've spent together, will all its imperfections. 
                    The little, mundane moments - they are all special to me.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Sean, the other protagonist of the film, reflects on the perception of regret. He confronts Will that regrets doesn't come from the mistakes or
                    the past we endured. Real regrets are about the missed opportunities, and the missed connections we don't make. He implies that true regrets
                    come from not having loved at all. If I never met you, that would be a regret. If we never made up, that would be a regret. 
                    If we never get to try, that would be regret.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In closing this note, I want to say "here's to cherishing the moments that we have." I am grateful for everything we've shared so far, and I look forward
                    to many more. Missing out in not trying this relationship of ours would be my greatest regret which is something I'd never I want to live with.
                    I am thankful everyday that we didn't let that happen.
                </p>
